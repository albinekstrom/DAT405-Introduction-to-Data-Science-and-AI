Group 2 1[1.0/1] good 2a [1.0/1] good 2b [1.0/1] good 2c [0.25/.5] Plot? 2d [1.5/1.5] OK 3a [0.75/1] Discussion of what max pooling does could be a lot more clear, same with dropout. 3b [0.25/1] Discussion very limited. 4a [1.0/1] 4b [0.5/.75] More digits should be considered. 4c [0.25/.5] The results here should be compared the output of your network on seasoned imaged, and compared to denoised images. 4d [0.0/.75] Solution is not effective. A better idea would be to consider the average of a number of latent space representation of the same digit and attempt to decode that, or to interpolate between two latent space representations.
