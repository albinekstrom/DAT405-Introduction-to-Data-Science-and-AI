2p 2p. Reasonable values obtained. No discussion regarding the values -1p. The policy function makes sense, but is not asked for here and should be discussed since every state has several equally good actions, and adding it without any comment makes me believe you have not understood it. For example. if you are in the center, any action that takes you out of the center is the optimal action. -1p. 0.5p Reasonable values, but no discussion. a) 0.25p, your code seem to get somewhat reasonable result, but it doesn’t agree with the Q-learning result from previous question and you don’t comment why or if it should or anything. b) 0.75, correct, but for full points I would have wanted you to add how this trade-off is dealt with. 0p No answer? Total: 5.5p Good job with the code. Keep in mind that discussions are important and always encouraged to show that you can interpret the results.
